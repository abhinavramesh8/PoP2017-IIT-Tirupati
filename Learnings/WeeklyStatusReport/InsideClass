What you learnt inside the class?

Week1
  
  i) I learnt about the different programming paradigms that are in vogue.
  ii) I learnt the pros and cons of writing in machine language.
  iii) I learnt about Edsger Dijkstra.
  
Week2

  i) I learnt about programming paradigms and examples of different languages.
  ii) I learnt about compilers, interpreters and the processes involved.
  iii) I learnt about syntax, semantics and parse trees.

Week3

  i) Learnt how Python and Haskell are different from C and C++.
  ii) Learnt the basics of functional programming in Haskell. I also learnt about the characteristic features
      of Haskell such as lazy evaluation.
  iii) I learnt the basics of Python and its object-oriented features. 

Week4

  i) Learnt about grammars and how they generate languages(teminals, non-terminals and productions).
  ii) I learnt about Backus Naur Form.
  iii) I learnt about parse trees and derivations.
  iv) I also learnt that grammars can be ambiguous.

Week5
  Learnt about various languages and the features they offer.
  
Week6
  i) I learnt about the 10 different programming styles.
  ii) I learnt some very interesting things like pipelining.
  
Week7
  i) I learnt some concrete things about functional programming.
  ii) I learnt about the evolution of various programming paradigms and a bit of history related to that.
  iii) Got to know the important features of object oriented programming.
  iv) I found out that the imperative style does not solve all problems effectively and that it is not good to just stick
      to one thing and to use the right style for a particular job.
