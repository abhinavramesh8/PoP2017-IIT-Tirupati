What you learnt outside the class?
Be specific...

Week1
  i) Started learning TypeScript. Found out that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. So, I am checking out the new features
     introduced in TypeScript that are not present in JavaScript.
     
  ii) I read about how binary search trees can be inefficient sometimes and how to combat this problem by balancing them.
  
  iii) I want to improve my coding standards. So, I searched on the net for resources and downloaded a book: Programming Pearls.
