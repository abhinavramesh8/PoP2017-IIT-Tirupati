What you learnt outside the class?
Be specific...

Week1
  i) Started learning TypeScript. Found out that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. So, I am checking out the new features
     introduced in TypeScript that are not present in JavaScript.
     
  ii) I read about how binary search trees can be inefficient sometimes and how to combat this problem by balancing them.
  
  iii) I want to improve my coding standards. So, I searched on the net for resources and downloaded a book: Programming Pearls.

Week2
  i) Learnt the basics of TypeScript.
  
  ii) Learnt some Graph Algorithms.
  
Week3
  i) Learnt the basics of Dart.
  ii) Continued learning TypeScript.
  iii) Solved 7 problems on Rosetta Code.
  
Week4
  i) Solved 2 Dart problems in Rosetta Code.
  ii) I learnt about grammars, derivations and the types of grammars, especially context-free grammars.
  iii) I experimeted with the C++ Standard Template Library. I have started using templates in my programs.
  
Week5
  i) I experimented with object oriented programming.
  ii) I also read a bit about TypeScript and what makes it different from JavaScript.
  
 Week6
  i) I learnt a lot about my language by reading the TypeScript specification.
  ii) I tried coding some algorithmic problems by using TypeScript.
  iii) I also experimented with the object-oriented features of TypeSCript as well as modules.
  iv) I found a good deal as to what TypeScrift offers and how it adds to JavaScript.
  v) I read about compiler/interpreter design and I learnt how to evaluate arithmetic expressions.
  
  Week7
    i) Continued learning about how to crete interpreters.
    ii) Learnt how to parse strings and to create parse trees.
    iii) I learnt about lexers and tokens.
    iv) I implemented circular array and stacks using TypeScript and realized that TypeScript is a lot better than JavaScript.
